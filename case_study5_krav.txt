Case study 5: 

As part of my development as an educator, I make the effort to learn
new and difficult things from time to time, specifically to experience
education "from the other side of the desk".

For about a year now, I have been practising krav maga, a combat
system originally developed for military use but now adapted for
civilian self-defense.  This followed pressure from my family to
become more physically active and to take more exercise (which is my
primary motivation for krav).

However, it is a salutary experience to learn something that I am not
very good at.  In general, adults simply do not do this.  As adults,
we are usually in control, and operate at pretty much a steady state
of competence.  Occasionally we move out of our comfort zone and take
an evening class in crochet or pottery or creative writing, but for
the most part we never attempt anything unless we are almost
guaranteed to succeed.

Compare this with two other groups: children and undergraduates.  Take
children first.  Their teachers and parents spare no effort in
cajoling and encouraging them to "just have a go!" in endeavours such
as horse riding, through ballet, chess, piano playing; the list is
endless.  A lot of this is with the explicit goal of gaining
"confidence", a line of thought that has troubled me for decades:
surely the goal is competence, not confidence? I do not view
confidence as being particularly desirable; the dangers of
over-confidence are surely obvious.  I guess guardians are worried
about extreme lack of confidence that discourages attempts at anything
new.  But surely confidence should be based on confidence, rather than
Mummy saying---with the very best of intensions---"you are good at
that".  Any half-way intelligent child sees this for the shallow
deception that it is, and of course Mummy's unshakeable faith will not
do one much good on the rugby field or boxing ring.  Faced with the
cognitive dissonance of being told how good one is at something, and
the harsh objective fact of being thrashed to nil repeatedly, I could
argue that "confidence" is, on balance, a liability.

The one exception to this general rule is undergraduates: university
courses typically contain "duty" subjects which one is obliged to
learn before graduation.  For example, psychology or biology majors
would be required to take at least one statistics course (I teach
statistics).  Many students take biology or psychology specifically
*because* they hated math at school but nevertheless were attracted to
science-type subjects.  And they wind up in STAT101 and they hate it.
I want to experience this, so I can deal with such students more
effectively.

And I have realised that krav maga allows me to do this.

By any conceivable standard of my instructor, I am hopeless at krav.
I am easily the oldest and crumbliest student there: I am 52 and I
would say that the next oldest student is in his early forties; most
of the class are in their mid twenties.  I have taken zero physical
exercise for ten years.  Quite apart from that, I studied karate as a
young man for many many years, and many karate techniques are
positively counterproductive for krav; I acquired what now appear to
be bad habits, which have to be unlearned (although having said that,
my jujitsu does seem to have marginal positive value, even if I have
forgotten most of it).  My instructor corrects my terrible movements
with gentle, resigned patience.

But on my own terms, I have enjoyed huge success. Notably, I've lost a
lot of weight: I've gone down two shirt sizes (from XXL in 2018 to L
today).  My clothes fit me better in general; I have more energy and
am eating better and more healthily (more fruit and almost no junk
food).  In the world of krav too, I am gradually acquiring the muscle
memory to execute some of the more basic techniques.  Subtle things:
occasionally, I am chosen to demonstrate a technique to the class.  I
am now allowed to partner with first-time students.  I can identify
slight discrepancies between the two instructors' techniques (which is
noticed).

A few weeks ago, I was training three times a week and this proved to
be domestically difficult.  I had a robust discussion of this with my
wife Lesley.  At one point I said (in the heat of an argument) that I
wanted to train three times a week "to show my instructors how much
I've improved".  Lesley said that I shouldn't be trying to impress the
instructors.

Impressing instructors is something that has fascinated me, in the
context of undergraduate statistics education, for long time.  It
worries me that, in emphasising the role of the educator (in this
case, encouraging students to work hard just to impress the lecturer)
is a short-term strategy: once the student leaves university, the
motivation to study vanishes.  Surely we as educators should be aiming
for life-long learning, and encouraging this kind of dependence on the
institution and lecturers is inimical to that.

So, perhaps we can learn something from my argument with Lesley.  What
I *meant* to say was that my instructors had shown me great patience
and long-suffering compassionate aid.  And I wanted to return the
favour by demonstrating commitment to krav.  I wanted their efforts
not to have been in vain; that is, I wanted to show them that their
instruction was effective, and appreciated.  And I do this in two
ways: attending more training sessions, and also by actually being a
better krav practitioner.

And what Lesley meant to say, I think, was that measuring one's worth
by reference to another's opinion is a shallow way to live one's life.

One result of reflecting on this issue has been that I try to
de-emphasise the role of the lecturer and tutor in undergraduate
statistics courses.  In the context of discussing exam marking of
students' work it is less of "if you demonstrate understanding of
concept X in the exam, you will impress me and get marks" and more of
"If you really understand concept X this is very useful [in biology]
and if you understand it, you can demonstrate this in the exam".  Note
the de-emphasis on the marker; note also the enhancement of the value
of the learning in and of itself (and also note the starting point is
the understanding, which leads to benefits).  I think this is an
important line of reasoning (in the context of educational leadership,
this has had a number of effects, but notably I call out "charismatic"
educators who I believe promote institutional dependency.  This is
*not* a popular thing to do, but I have to do it).

However, the issue is more complicated than that.  Let's accept for
the moment the notion of education as "introduction to a community of
practice".  The community in question is mathematicians, so what do
real mathematicians like me do?  Well, I spend my time trying to
impress other mathematicians (notably in the process of peer-review
but also in conferences).  So perhaps emphasising that student work to
impress me isn't that bad an idea.
