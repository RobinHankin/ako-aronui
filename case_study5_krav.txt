Case study 5: 

As part of my development as an educator, I make the effort to learn
new and difficult things from time to time, specifically to experience
education "from the other side of the desk".

For about a year now, I have been practising krav maga, a combat
system originally developed for military use but now adapted for
civilian self-defense.  This followed pressure from my family to
become more physically active and to take more exercise (which is my
primary motivation for krav).

However, it is a salutary experience to learn something that I am not
very good at.  In general, adults simply do not do this.  As adults,
we are usually in control, and operate at pretty much a steady state
of competence.  Occasionally we move out of our comfort zone and take
an evening class in crochet or pottery or creative writing, but for
the most part we never attempt anything unless we are almost
guaranteed to succeed.

Compare this with two other groups: children and undergraduates.  Take
children first.  Their teachers and parents spare no effort in
cajoling and encouraging them to "just have a go!" in endeavours such
as horse riding, through ballet, chess, piano playing; the list is
endless.  A lot of this is with the explicit goal of gaining
"confidence", a line of thought that has troubled me for decades:
surely the goal is competence, not confidence? I do not view
confidence as being particularly desirable; the dangers of
over-confidence are surely obvious.  I guess guardians are worried
about extreme lack of confidence that discourages attempts at anything
new.  But surely confidence should be based on confidence, rather than
Mummy saying---with the very best of intensions---"you are good at
that".  Any half-way intelligent child sees this for the shallow
deception that it is, and of course Mummy's unshakeable faith will not
do one much good on the rugby field or boxing ring.  Faced with the
cognitive dissonance of being told how good one is at something, and
the harsh objective fact of being thrashed to nil repeatedly, I could
argue that "confidence" is, on balance, a liability.

The one exception to this general rule is undergraduates: university
courses typically contain "duty" subjects which one is obliged to
learn before graduation.  For example, psychology or biology majors
would be required to take at least one statistics course (I teach
statistics).  Many students take biology or psychology specifically
*because* they hated math at school but nevertheless were attracted to
science-type subjects.  And they wind up in STAT101 and they hate it.
I want to experience this, so I can deal with such students more
effectively.

And I have realised that krav maga allows me to do this.

By any conceivable standard of my instructor, I am hopeless at krav.
I am easily the oldest and crumbliest student there: I am 52 and I
would say that the next oldest student is in his early forties; most
of the class are in their mid twenties.  I have taken zero physical
exercise for ten years.  Quite apart from that, I studied karate as a
young man for many many years, and many karate techniques are
positively counterproductive for krav; I acquired what now appear to
be bad habits, which have to be unlearned (although having said that,
my jujitsu knowledge does seem to have marginal positive value, even
if I have forgotten most of it).  My instructor corrects my terrible
accent (sic) with gentle if resigned patience.

But on my own terms, I have enjoyed huge success. Notably, I've lost a
lot of weight: I've gone down two shirt sizes (from XXL in 2018 to L
today).  My clothes fit me better in general; I have more energy and
am eating better and more healthily (more fruit and almost no junk
food).  In the world of krav, I am gradually acquiring the muscle
memory to execute some of the more basic techniques.
