Case study 5: 

As part of my development as an educator, I make the effort to learn
new and difficult things from time to time, specifically to experience
education "from the other side of the desk".

For about a year now, I have been practising krav maga, a combat
system originally developed for military use but now adapted for
civilian self-defense.  This followed pressure from my family to
become more physically active and to take more exercise.
