Case study 4:  martial arts

As part of my development as an educator, I make the effort to learn
new and difficult things from time to time, specifically to experience
education "from the other side of the desk".

My daughter Annabel has practised taekwondo for over seven years.  She
is now only one test away from attaining a black belt, and will be
grading next year.  My view is that martial arts somehow motivate
young men and women to study an abstract and demanding discipline,
over many years, with no immediate payoff.  As far as motivation is
concerned, martial arts are succeeding where mathematics education is
failing.  In this case study I will investigate this observation.
