Case study 4: Factorio

As part of my development as an educator, I make the effort to learn
new and difficult things from time to time, specifically to experience
education "from the other side of the desk".

My son Zachary is an avid computer gamer and partly as a result of
trying to understand his world, I bought a computer game called
"Factorio" which he has spent a large amount of time playing.
