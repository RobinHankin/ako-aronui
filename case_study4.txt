Case study 4:  taekwondo

I am very interested in motivation, interpreted in its most general
form as an abstract guiding principle for behaviour.  For my teaching,
the motivation I am most concerned about is motivation to study
mathematics.

From the perspective of motivation, mathematics education is an
unmitigated failure.  Students hate it and have to be bullied or
otherwise coerced into studying a system of essentially zero value.
In this case study I consider one form of human activity, martial
arts, which seems to motivate its students highly effectively; I
ponder whether we mathematics educators can learn anything from the
martial arts community.

My daughter Annabel has practised taekwondo for over seven years.  She
is now only one test away from attaining a black belt, and will be
grading next year.  My view is that martial arts somehow motivate
young men and women to study an abstract and demanding discipline,
over many years, with no immediate payoff.  As far as motivation is
concerned, martial arts are succeeding where mathematics education is
failing.

There follow a number of possible explanations for the discrepancy.
